# FuzzPhyte Unity Tools

## Tool

FP_Tool is designed and built to be a simple set of base classes designed around interactive 'tool' use for 2D and 3D experiences. In a lot of Unity projects you find that you need some sort of 'weapon' and/or 'tool' that has the same sort of set of states: you have the tool (in hand), you are using the tool, you have stopped using the tool, and/or you have dropped the tool.

## Setup & Design

## License Notes

* This software running a dual license
* Most of the work this repository holds is driven by the development process from the team over at Unity3D :heart: to their never ending work on providing fantastic documentation and tutorials that have allowed this to be born into the world.
* I personally feel that software and it's practices should be out in the public domain as often as possible, I also strongly feel that the capitalization of people's free contribution shouldn't be taken advantage of.
  * If you want to use this software to generate a profit for you/business I feel that you should equally 'pay up' and in that theory I support strong copyleft licenses.
  * If you feel that you cannot adhere to the GPLv3 as a business/profit please reach out to me directly as I am willing to listen to your needs and there are other options in how licenses can be drafted for specific use cases, be warned: you probably won't like them :rocket:

  * If the funding line is affiliated with an [SBIR](https://www.sbir.gov) be aware that when/if you transfer this work to a small business that work will have to be moved under the secondary license as mentioned below.
